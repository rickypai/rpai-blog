Boeing 747 and its full might viewed straight ahead. Too bad this photo wasn't perfectly centered!

Once in a while, instead of having gates connected right to the aircraft door, travelers hopped on buses heading to the aircraft and board by stairs. Airports do this when they don't have enough gate capacity, or when operating regional jets that are not compatible with jetway bridges.

Most fliers hate this, especially when it exposes them to unpredictable weather conditions. Personally, I've learned to love those rare opportunities to ride on some of the world's most advanced buses, and to see see aircrafts up close, sometimes without windows in between.

I'm posting about these bus rides because I recently had a five hour layover in Tokyo Narita International Airport (NRT), and used most of the time to walk around the airport, including riding the bus that connects all terminals. I got many amazing photos of the facility and individual aircrafts, but I want to dedicate the adventure to another post when all the photos are ready.

For now, photos from Frankfurt Airport (FRA), as it is the first time I discovered the joy of riding in airport buses~

It's actually a bit embarrassing to view such beauty so close to its rear. The reason why I had such thought shows that I have strange attachments to their appeal.

Just such a small window of view shows that this is probably a United Airlines Boeing 777, probably one that I was about to catch at the time!

Another magnificent view of the Boeing 747.
