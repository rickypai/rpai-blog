Another day of flying. These days, it is almost as if you need to pick a fight just to get your bloody bags checked without hassle. US airlines, I feel, despite improving hardware with new planes and retrofits, are still quite lacking in software. (same is often said with China as a whole)

I once flew on perhaps the most primitive form of aviation - a hot air balloon. While the seats and cabin services are nothing to write home about, the experience was quite otherworldly.

We woke up before sunrise and were driven into uncharted plains of Kenya. The only light visible were fires filling up the balloons. Boarding process was a breeze, and everyone got a nice window seat. The rest, lets save for a more elaborate post.

Also writing this thirty five thousand feet in the air en route to Los Angeles for a short connection. The next flight to Tokyo will put me into February 6 so this window is the only time I have to pull out the photo from my portable hard drive, make quick edits to the photo if necessarily, and upload the daily post.

I hope there is enough time.
