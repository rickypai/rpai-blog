![Happiest Day of Yukie's Life](http://static.rickypai.com/blog/2013/photo-a-day/2013-02-01-happiest-day/D3P_9399.jpg)

Having a blog is one thing, maintaining is another. While this blog has been up for about two weeks, I have struggled to add contents to it. The self-censorship is still at work, but most of the time laziness is to blame. The best way, I figured, is to make a daily routine of posting.

Though I may not have something insightful to write about everyday, I do have a giant repository of nearly 120,000 photos, most of which have never been seen by the world. A [Photo a Day](/blog/categories/photo-a-day/) initiative is the perfect solution to let those dusting photos see light while seeding this blog with fresh substance.

Onto the photo, one of the pleasant surprises when I first returned to AMURICA was attending my friend Yukie's wedding. It was the first American-style wedding that I attended, and its simplicity awes me. Chinese weddings tend to be overly extravagant as they are also used to display the family's wealth and connections, while American weddings are much more subtle with greater focus on the lucky couple.

I chose this photo to open up the series as I hope to expand my photography beyond just cosplay, which constitutes more than half of my photos, and I look forward to sharing more works here!

(By the way, if you are planning a wedding and need a photographer, let me know and let's work something out!)
