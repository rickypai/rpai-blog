If I were an marketing major, I would probably name it something like "Enteric Vermicelli"; and if I were from the propaganda office of North Korea, "Dear Leader's Noodles with Internals of Capitalist Scum". As you can see, I am unfit for either position, so I am going to use the literal translation "Pig Intestine Thin Noodle", which makes it sound a lot more unappetizing than it really is.

Visited Banciao, sort a suburb of Taipei, for a photoshoot with [HIKO](/blog/categories/hiko/). After the shoot, we roamed around to indulge on the various culinary delights in town.

First was the "Pig Intestine Thin Noodle" above, then "Stinky Tofu", and finally "Chicken Egg Cake". As you can see, Taiwanese people are very literal when it comes to naming our food.

Stinky tofu is made by letting the tofu ferment a bit, hence the "stinky" name, then either fry or steam it
