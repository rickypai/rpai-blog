I've always been quite avid in my indulgence in information; however, being a mere consumer means I have limited outlet to share knowledge and opinions of my own. Part of my resolve for the year is to give back what I have learned over the years, through my personal explorations and travels, back to this very world with a blog of my own.

Actually, starting a blog has long been an unchecked item on my mental life TODO list, but there were many reasons why this was never materialized due to my inability to decide on a topic focus and hosted platform.

Luckily, I thought of a brilliant idea yesterday of hosting an Octopress blog as static pages on Amazon S3, an idea which turned out to be not-so-original, but worked out really nicely, as you can see here. In a later post, I will go through how this compares with other platforms and deployment strategies, and more importantly, how to set this up.

And the topic of interest? Everything!

I will be writing just about everything I care about, which can span from web development to air travel. Hope this will interest you as much as it does to me!
