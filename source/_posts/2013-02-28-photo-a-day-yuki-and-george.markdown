Just poasting my two good goofy friend couple who bring me to awesome beer~~~

Now that I think about it, there hasn't been a person I don't like who also likes fine beer.

A bit about this blog. Posting a photo a day turned out to be a lot more taxing than I thought. While it is indeed a good way to show the works I've been hoarding over the years, the frequency doesn't really allow much in depth write ups.

Now that the project has reached a full month, I want to shift focus to less frequent but more detailed posts, probably sets of photos that share a common theme or document a particular adventure.

We will see how things go next month. I'm starting the month with a few photo trips so perhaps I will find some new insights~
