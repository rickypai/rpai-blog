Visited a Taiwanese event Fancy Frontier 21, my first being Fancy Frontier 8 six years ago.

Roamed around and saw this uncle. Asked if his beard was real, he replied that he couldn't understand Chinese.

Pointing to my chin and saying in crude Japanese "real?", he replied "this is the real deal!"

At this point, I was tearing rainbows, and asked if I could take his photo. He happily agreed.

I want his beard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Also a more detailed postmortem to follow, but right now I have to run to the second day of the event!
