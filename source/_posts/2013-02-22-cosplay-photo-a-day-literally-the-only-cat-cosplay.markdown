It puzzles me. I wonder if trends like this have persisted or it is only recently that I started noticing it, but once in a while there are special days like today, 2/22 as cat day, or 11/29 as good thigh day. During those days, the Asian social mediasphere goes crazy with themed postings of related images.

After doing some research, most of those days seem to originate from Japan. The reason being, the simplicity of the Japanese phonetics allows days to be interpreted as different homonyms.

For example, today, 2/22, is pronounced ni-ni-ni (ニニニ). Ni (ニ) is the first syllabal for "nyan" (ニャン), the Japanese word for cat moan. Whereas 11/27 is pronounced i-i-ni-ku(イイニク), which is the homonym for 'good meat' (いい肉).

The Washington Post apparently wrote an in depth article on the day: [Japan is celebrating its 27th annual Cat Day today, also known as Nyan Nyan Nyan day](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/02/22/japan-is-celebrating-its-27th-annual-cat-day-today-also-known-as-nyan-nyan-nyan-day/). So I guess this has been going on for quite a sometime, beginning from times even predating the internet, nyancat, ihazcheeseburger, and grumpy cat.

In observation of 'cat day', I decided to post a cat-related cosplay photo (it makes picking what to post and what to write about relatively easy). To my surprise, looking through my six years worth cosplay photos, only very few (less than ten) are of characters related to cats or have cat ears. And of those, only this one is presentable.

So here it is, literally the only cat cosplay photo I have, Ashteyz as Cheshire Cat from Pandora Hearts, and Astellecia as Will of the Abyss from the same series.
