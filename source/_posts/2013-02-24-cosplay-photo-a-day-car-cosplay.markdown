Not entirely sure if this counts as cosplay, but it is of cars 'dressing up' to express other characters. Perhaps it is more of a car alternative fashion, but whatever.

This is phenomenon is called "itasha" (痛車), literally translates to "painmobile". I don't really understand the origin of the term, but I suppose dressing up cars in such a way is painful for the wallet.

Wikipedia defines [itasha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itasha) as such:

> Itasha (痛車), literally "painmobile", is a Japanese term for an otaku fad of individuals decorating the bodies of their cars with fictional characters of anime, manga, or video games (especially bishōjo game or eroge).

Additionally,

> Itai here means "painful", which can be interpreted as "painfully embarrassing" or "painful for the wallet" due to the high costs involved. The name is also a pun for Italian cars (イタリア車 Itaria-sha), truncated in Japanese slang as Itasha (イタ車).

So here is your daily dose of random trivia. Posting this because I may be taking a written test for a driver's license tomorrow.
