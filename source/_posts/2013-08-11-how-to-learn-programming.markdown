Recently, a lot of people have been asking how I learned programming. The answer is simple: Just do it.

Pick up a project, and just do it. The project doesn't have to be big, even a simple page that prints 'Hello World!' in different fonts, colors, and hosted on your own .com domain name is a good start with lots of learning opportunities. My first ever page was just a HTML page filled with Starcraft images. It took me years before I started building [photo galleries filled with security holes](https://github.com/rickypai/oh-nostalgia/tree/master/gallerytest). Today, I build new features into [Twitter's advertising platform](https://ads.twitter.com/) helping advertisers reach millions of users. I've come a long way, but with all the resources available online today, you can progress even faster.

Take the 'Hello World!' example I just mentioned, say you know nothing about HTML, where do you start?

[Intro to HTML](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&pws=0&q=intro+to+html)<br>
[Changing Color of Text in HTML](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&pws=0&q=changing+color+of+text+in+html)<br>
[Changing Font of Text in HTML](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&pws=0&q=changing+font+of+text+in+html)

You can see where this is going: Google is a fantastic resource for learning. It even applies to specific topics that I had to look up this past week:

[git undo rebase](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&pws=0&q=git+undo+rebase)<br>
[rails render 404](https://www.google.com/search?q=rails+render+404&hl=en)<br>
[factory girl initialize with](https://www.google.com/search?q=factory+girl+initialize_with)

Just imagine this like using wikipedia to finish college essays.

Not convinced? My friend Dan Tang, asked me this precise question about a year and a half ago. He then starting coding on his free time while keeping his I-Banking day job, learning multiple languages. Today, he spearheads an educational software startup, and trashtalks my choice of language. One of the most effective thing he does (and one I fail to do) is logging his work on his [personal blog](http://dancodingblog.herokuapp.com/blog), which he also coded himself.

I hope this inspires you to start coding. And feel free to ask me @[rickypaipie](https://twitter.com/rickypaipie) for any questions!

Also, if you prefer more structured courses, look into [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) and [code school](http://www.codeschool.com/), where they offer interactive courses in many topics.

Happy coding!
