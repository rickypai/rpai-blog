This is hybridre, one of the greatest cosplay photographers, and today is her birthday!

During my brief visit to Beijing in late 2011, she invited me to this Madoka Magica shoot. Knowing that there would be Kyoko and Sayaka, I brought some speedlights with blue and red gels to compliment the colors. It probably wasn't part of her normal workflow, but still an interesting shoot nonetheless. The shots you see here went through zero color edits.

As for the shoot itself, I don't think I did particularly well so better to see the photos from her. And once again, I had to leave the shoot early to catch a flight. :storyofmylife:
