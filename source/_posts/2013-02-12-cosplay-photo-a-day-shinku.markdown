It's getting harder and harder to find red cosplay photos to post. This particular shot dates back to 2006. If I want to do this for the next Chinese New Year, I better arrange some red shoots or else I'd have nothing to post. I reckon some good old communist cosplay with a splash of patriotism would do nicely.

The photo is of Shinku from Rozen Maiden. I can not recall the cosplayer's name as it was quite some time ago, but I do remember her lugging that piece of luggage into the event.

Also, some time during college, a classmate asked me what anime I watched. I replied "Rozen Maiden" because I literally was following it at the time, then she gave me a face of disgust and stopped talking to me. I admit it isn't the mainliest of animes, but I quite liked the character design and had some shoots planned for it at the time so~

On the topic of red, an ad that is the best I've seen of the aviation industry and one that even rivals most [superbowl](/blog/2013/02/03/photo-a-day-game-day/) ads!
