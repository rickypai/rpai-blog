Originally, I planned to leave Taiwan on friday, but I realized that I didn't have any time to catch up with friends in Taipei so I changed the ticket for a later departure.

Incidentally, the extended stay also coincides with one of the biggest events in Taiwan, Fancy Frontier 21. It would be quite a shame for me not to pay a visit, especially when I wouldn't know when is the next time I'd be in town.

I must say I had a lot of fun. In fact, probably the most fun of late compared to recent events. It deserves a detailed postmortem, but for now, enjoy this glorious team of [Miku](/blog/categories/hatsune-miku/)~

From left, 御風, 大白, 海冥, and 瑪瑙. 御風 I've known pretty much since the day I started shooting cosplay, so it is quite a delight to see her again!

According to her, I look like I am in my 30s despite us being around the same age... not sure if that is a good thing or not.
