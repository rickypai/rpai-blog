Standing in the middle of Times Square at night gives a sense that you are standing in the center of the world with the planet's biggest brand names constantly trying to entice you with colored lights.

Though during the day, especially on weekends, it is a bloody zoo best to be avoided. It doesn't look nearly as nice also!

So one interesting thing about this shot was that it was taken with my iPhone. Cameras have improved great lengths it is actually quite astonishing what they are capable of these days. There are a few more photos from this blog that were also taken with the iPhone. Can you spot them?
