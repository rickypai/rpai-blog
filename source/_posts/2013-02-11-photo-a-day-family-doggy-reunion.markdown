This is one of my niece with QQ~

My family is pretty small with the extended family spread around different parts of Taiwan and the world, so we often hang out and celebrate holidays with the Wang family who also resides in Kaohsiung. This Chinese New Year, we all gathered in a mountain resort away from the city. One common trait between the families is the shared love of dogs~ so this reunion also included about half dozen four-legged family members~
