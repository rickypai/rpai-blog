I don't usually write reviews, but when I do, I review places worth re-visiting.

I went on a hiatus of blogging for the past six weeks. Partly because job search started running on full intensity, but also because the routine of posting daily was much more tiring than I thought. What I missed was the act of reorganizing thoughts and experience into words, so I want to resume this, amid without a fixed daily schedule.

Currently in London for a brief hiatus before starting my new job. London is quite a great place with very rich history and dynamic neighborhoods, but what truly fascinates me is the tea culture.

Yumchaa is a great place to start. It boasts a great selection of loose-leaf teas, and an array of sampling cups for you to smell and choose from the very classic Earl Grey to the more interesting Lemon Sherbet. The tea I picked is Notting Hill, a light black tea with lots of fragrant fruit notes. The Gunpowder Mint my friend chose was equally refreshing.

The shop itself has an abundance of natural light, with the front outfitted with large ground windows, and the other half with windowed ceilings. There are also cozy dark corners with couches if that is preferred. The atmosphere is a relaxing one, but there is also room to be productive should you sit at one of the larger desks where people focus on work.

However, this probably isn't a glamorous attraction should this is be your first visit to London, but I still highly recommend it just to smell and try the tea and maybe bring back a pack or two. This certainly is a great place to relax on an afternoon, or really concentrate on the work at hand. In this particular case, writing this blog post.
