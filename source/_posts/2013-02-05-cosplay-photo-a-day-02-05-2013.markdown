There a few reasons why I chose this photo:

- It is edited
- It is already on my computer
- It has never been uploaded by me, I think
- It is one of the few cosplay photos in landscape orientation, as I have not really settled with a good layout for photos in portrait orientation

And above all, my next flight to Tokyo that is about to start boarding. By the time I am on the ground again, it will be February 6 already.

I will edit a fresh photo on the flight, so fresh that even the cosplayer has not seen it before.

See you in Tokyo.
