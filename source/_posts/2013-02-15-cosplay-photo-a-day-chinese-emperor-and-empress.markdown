Had a photoshoot with [HIKO](/blog/categories/hiko/) for the first time today! She is crazy fun to work with!

We visited a historic private garden for the shoot, little did we know that the venue was also hosting some sort of cultural festival. Upon seeing the cut-outs of some random Chinese emperor and empress, she immediately suggested "Here's one for your Photo a Day project~", which I happily obliged.

Then I suggested that we might as well take the cutout with us around the garden for a photoshoot, cosplaying as the Chinese emperor and empress. Too bad that didn't happen =p
