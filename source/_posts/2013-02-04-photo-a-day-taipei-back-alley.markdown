![Taipei Back Alley](http://static.rickypai.com/blog/2013/photo-a-day/2013-02-04/D3P_7136.jpg)

I don't have much to say today as it has been a long day and I have already exhausted the last remaining bits of my brain juice on the [inaugural post](/blog/2013/02/04/cosplay-photo-a-day-hiko-on-stage/) of a new parallel series [Cosplay Photo a Day](/blog/categories/cosplay-photo-a-day/).

I'm actually quite surprised that I've been able to keep up with the routine posting without interruption especially when previous attempts ended after a mere two posts. What is perhaps more surprising is having this much to write about in each post. I hope to keep up with this forever, or until the grammar nazis take away my laptop from my cold dead hands.

The photo is of a back alley of Taipei. I am tempted to say Taipeinese back alley but the spell check already freaked out. Posting this as I am flying back to Taiwan for Chinese New Years. The trip was decided quite last minute as I figured that once I'm settled in AMURICA, there'd be less chance to return and see my parents. Also frequent flier miles.

The flight departs in a few hours, and I have yet started packing. Just wait for the day I miss my flight because I was trying to make my daily post before a date-changing flight. Actually, if that happens, it provides materials for another post about me missing my flight for making a post.

The last time posting was this fun was the old [Crime and Punishment](http://community.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=channel&channelID=12451) board of [EVE Online](http://www.eveonline.com/).
