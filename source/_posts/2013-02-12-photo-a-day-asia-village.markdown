We stayed at a mountain resort called [Asia Village](http://www.sunping.com.tw/) with the extended family during most of the Chinese New Year. It so happened that the owner of the resort saw me with my camera and decided to hold a small contest of photographing one of the resort's fine buildings against his son-in-law who had a 5D Mk-II or Mk-III on his neck.

This was the result, and I took home a small price money of NTD$1000, which comes down to about USD$33.

A pretty nice surprise, I must say~

Should any of you visit or reside in southern Taiwan, [Asia Village](http://www.sunping.com.tw/) is a great spot for a nice relaxing weekend getaway from the busy city life. I know I took the owner's money, but I recommend this place with the highest sincerity.
