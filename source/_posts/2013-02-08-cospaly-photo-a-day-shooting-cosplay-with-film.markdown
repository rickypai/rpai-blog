I've been having a lot of nostalgic moments about shooting film, so posting possibly my best cosplay photo on film. For comparison, a similar photo shot in digital.

As you can see, the color rendition is vastly different between film and digital. There is more than just color depth that makes film amazing, but lets save that for another post.

Actually, I have been having second thoughts about keeping up with two series of [Photo a Day](/blog/categories/photo-a-day/) and [Cosplay Photo a Day](/blog/categories/cosplay-photo-a-day/). While I do have a lot of cosplay photos, I find less inspired to post and write about them.

On to the photo, 紅月凌 (TW) as Chise from Saikano. Looking back into the archives, this is likely the only set from 2006 I feel good enough to post today. Only luck and perhaps [miracle](/blog/2013/02/07/cosplay-photo-a-day-miracles-of-2010/) can explain how those images were produced.
