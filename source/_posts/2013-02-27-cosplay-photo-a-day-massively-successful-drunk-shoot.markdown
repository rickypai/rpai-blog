I don't usually shoot drunk, but when I do...

Story was that I got really wasted one event by literally walking around with a sake bottle and found it empty by dawn. At some point, Rai found me and we started shooting.

I recall the process roughly being:

1. Hmmm rets composition dis shit
2. FUCKKIT
3. CLICK ALL THE WAY

and this is what happened.

Rai Kamishiro as Akita Neru from VOCALOID.

By the way, SHE IS ALSO AMAZING MUSICIAN GO [LISSEN TO HER MUSIC](http://raikamishiro.bandcamp.com/)!!!!!!!!111
