I can really use some inner peace right now. Not in a particularly good state of mind today.

Visited a Buddhist temple for the morning, and took some photos of it.

Also, since I have been posting high resolution photos in order to support retina display, this site has been quite a strain to load for some users with the index page being about ~10MB in size. The index page now only shows two posts per page, and for posts with more photos like this one, a read more tag.

I will investigate on making retina support dynamic so non-retina users don't have to load 2x images.
