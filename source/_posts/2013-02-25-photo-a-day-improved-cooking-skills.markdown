Haven't seen my friend Manica for a while so she invited me over to be her lab rat of this recipe she found online. Her cooking improved dramatically, and the pasta quite delicious, but I will have to give it a few days before my final verdict.

After all, I don't have health insurance in America. I do, however, have plenty of stomach medicine stocked up, the Japanese variant also, so I should be ok. (Japanese have really prevalent gastric problems due to their relatively more stressful lifestyles)

Also glorious lunch of sushi, udon, and tempura I had~
