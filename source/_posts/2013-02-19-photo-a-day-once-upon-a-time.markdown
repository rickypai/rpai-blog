After some quarrels, he arrived at the airport 25 minutes before departure, bought the ticket on the spot, rushed to the gate, and took the closest aisle seat despite being assigned a window seat.

- Sit in your window seat
- Get to the airport at least one hour before departure (two hours is bullshit)
- Don't do drugs
