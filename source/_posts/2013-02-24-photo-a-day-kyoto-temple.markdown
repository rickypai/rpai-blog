Had a farewell dinner for a friend who is leaving for two months to travel around Asia mainly in Taiwan and Japan.

She is visiting the Kansai (関西) region, where the older capitals such as Kyoto (京都) and Nara (奈良) are located. This area boasts numerous historic castle and temples, which are by far my favorite subjects of travel photography.

The dinner group also contemplated about visiting Japan together late next year. Should it happen, instead of ordering items on the menu blindly, we would have someone who might actually know what we are eating!

Looking back into the archives, I'm quite surprised at how few photos I took during the trip when this photo occurred. Compared to then, I am now less shy about brining out the camera out, and also became much better at spotting photo opportunities.

This actually makes me really looking forward to the next time I visit Japan, and also the images I will bring back.

Until next time, perhaps Kyushu (九州)!
