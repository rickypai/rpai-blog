Cats are such odd creatures. Sometimes, you can stick a lens up to their nose and they won't move an inch. Other times, you just sit there with your camera, and they naturally gravitate toward you, giving the best eye contact.

Dogs, on the other hand, are almost always in a hyperventilated state when you try to photograph them. So unless you tempt them with the prospect of treats, they will just roam around drolling happiness allover the place. Even should you bribe them, their eye contact is fixated on the treat while making the hungriest derp expressions.

Actually, I once photographed a dog who sat still quite nicely. Kuma is his name, a little Shiba Inu he is. The problem was, he wouldn't pay any attention to me, but when any stranger comes, should she be a cute girl, Kuma would give out his best smile to her.

So here, a photo a Kuma also.

Look how euphoric he was being surrounded by all the ladies!

One day I want to get a cat. And a dog. And maybe a bird also. They would hopefully be best friends together, and I can just dedicate the blog with posts and photos of them so I won't have to suffer from writers' block.

Maybe they'd get into a love triangle, or the dog found the cat hiding the bird for supper, or something. The possibilities are endless!
