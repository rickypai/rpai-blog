Back in college, not many of us actually believed the notion that college was the "best four years of your lives". It wasn't until we parted ways into different professions in all ends of the world that we realized how magical those years were.

One of the many highlights for me was our apartment. While most people simply find roommates to share the burden of rent, the three of us were brought together because of mutual interest in life and fine alcohol.

We would gather in our living room, many times spontaneously, and open up a nice wine or beer, followed by a selection of otherworldly liquors from Scottish whisky to Taiwanese gaoliang.

What would accompany the fine drinks were conversations that span the whole world and encompass all interests.

This weekend, we met again, we indulged on the many new treasures we discovered, and conversed about the blind cravings for opinions in Taiwan, prospects of various tech companies, and how world we live in is just a big financial scam.

And of course, Gundam.
