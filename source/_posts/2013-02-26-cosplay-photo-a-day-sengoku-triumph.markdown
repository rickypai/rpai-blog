When shooting in the Olympic Park of Beijing, we encountered this Danish guy who was more than intrigued by our activities.

Upon chatting, he requested a photo with the cosplayer. Given the permission, he immediately stripped and lied down before the cosplayer. None of us expected this, and I personally think his 'death' looked too willing.

Tough I was supposed to send him the photo, I subsequently lost many business cards in a horrific incident few days later in Shanghai. Seeing how recently my facebook friends have been able to identify strangers in the photos I took, lets see if anyone actually knows him! By the way, my vague memory tells me that he is Danish, but I may be wrong.

岚陵萧萧声 as Sanada Yukimura from Sengoku BASARA.
