In observation of Valentineâ€™s Day, a loving couple from the Vocaloid song Magnet featuring Lina Lau as [Megurine Luka](/blog/categories/megurine-luka/) and Xytnn as [Hatsune Miku](/blog/categories/hatsune-miku/).

While I've shot Magnet many times before, I always find it particularly difficult to get the vibe right. The shoot requires immensely good synergy between the cosplayers, or else often times you end up with just two girls holding hands and looking awkwardly at each other.

Fortunately, I've worked with many great pairs of Magnet cosplayers. The best times are when the Luka is extremely seme and the Miku legitimately uke.

Lina and Xytnn are such a delight to work with, but I must also credit another friend Julia Laurent for getting the right emotions in this photo. It was her who really helped to install the scents of passion in the shoot, or else I must admit I'm way too inexperienced in matters of love to get it right.

Anyways, I was going to post my favorite version of magnet, but I suppose it was deemed too scary and has since been taken off both NicoNico and Youtube. So something similar:
