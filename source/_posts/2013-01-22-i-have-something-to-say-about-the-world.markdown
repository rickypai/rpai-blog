Starting a blog has long been an unchecked item on my lifelong TODO list, along with items such as visiting Pyongyang via Air Koryo and losing consciousness during Oktoberfest. While some may never happen due to [events beyond my own control](http://www.flyertalk.com/the-wing/china-grounds-north-koreas-air-koryo.html), starting a blog isnt.

The main reason for such delay has been the inability to settle on a platform, and topic of focus. There is also the intrinsic insecurity of starting a blog and not having any audience. But should I remain in idleness ("Heresy grows from idleness" - [Dawn of War: Imperium Thought for the Day](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000:_Dawn_of_War)), the pile of unorganized text files in my "to be posted in a blog one day" folder will not post themselves, and no one will ever know the full depth of my eccentricity, and perhaps stupidity.

So here it is. I have something to say about the world, and I will say them here.

There is no filter of topics (lets try this for now), so anything from air travel to web development to life stories will go. It is generated with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) into static pages on Amazon S3 served by Amazon CloudFront. This is the most elegant way of hosting a blog that I know to date. A technical post on its soul-crushing advantages how to set this up shall follow (along with many more posts).

So hello and welcome! Fasten your seatbelt and enjoy your stay.
