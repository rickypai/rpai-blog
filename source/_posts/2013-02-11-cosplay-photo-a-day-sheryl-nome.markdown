Another red cosplay in observation of Chinese New Year, Skye as Sheryl Nome from Macross Frontier.

This was from my first trip in Singapore. Not having met Skye in person meant I had to go around the event and mistake people with the awkward greeting "are you Skye?", an act that was met with too much embarrassment. It's good that I finally got to meet her in the end lolol.
