Here is a dilemma when picking a photo to post when I am already late, there are three options available:

- Interesting photo that I have a lot to write about (but don't have time to write right now)
- Boring photo
- Be even later

In the interest of time, an apocalyptic looking Minecraft photo.

Sorry that my past 24 hours have been quite full, so I didn't have much time to pick or write. I should probably prepare pre-written articles so I can use during busy travels in the future.
