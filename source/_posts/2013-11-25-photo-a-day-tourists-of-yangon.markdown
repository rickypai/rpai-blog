Woke up early this morning, edited a photo of my fellow travelers in [Yangon](/blog/categories/yangon/), sent them this, and they were quite delighted. =)

It reminded me of all the beautiful colors of the country, and the trove of photos that have never seen the light of the internet.

I also realized that the morning is strangely productive for photo editing! So I will try to resume this [Photo a Day](/blog/categories/photo-a-day/) project. Hopefully, this time, it will last more than a month.

I hope to visit Myanmar again. Next time, more than just Yangon!
