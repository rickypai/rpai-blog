While my [Photo a Day](/blog/categories/photo-a-day/) initiative has been more of an exercise of pairing thought with photographs, the [Cosplay Photo a Day](/blog/categories/cosplay-photo-a-day/) parallel series is more of the opposite of finding thought in existing photographs. Originally, I planned of just revisiting old shoots and writing about how each progressed and/or how the photos were processed. This mode has several flaws, however,  as most of the time I don't remember how they went, or there just wasn't enough to write about.

Or they just happened so spontaneously that I can not offer any good explanation to how things came to place.

What would happen a lot is, I met someone for the first time at an event, which already is a poor pretext because usually you want to do a private shoot with good suitable backdrops, and hopefully with someone you already know for good synergy. We'd properly shoot for the first time, then BAM, I can not believe what is on my camera LCD and a personal legend is born.

Looking back into the archives, this occurred on so many occasions in 2010 to the point that I think the year was somehow doped with illegal substances. The year was also odd in the sense that, it also had the most number of shoots that went unposted. I guess it took a lot of mediocrity to balance with all the miracles.

The photo is of 花鯨 (TW) as Holo from Spice and Wolf. Just like most other unexpected shots, I either never work with the subject again or can't find the same mojo. That's what make those images even more precious.
