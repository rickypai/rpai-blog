![The Path Less Taken](http://static.rickypai.com/blog/2013/photo-a-day/2013-02-02/DSCF2593.jpg)

There are always clearly defined paths in life, ones that are thought to be optimal. Thought to be optimal because of their predictable outcomes, but it is often the path less taken that makes life truly worth living.

The Golden Gate Bridge. Each year, hordes of tourists pay tribute to this magnificent structure, and almost all of them are equipped with a camera to witness the moment.

"Me Too" photos, perhaps millions of them, is the one reason I, time after time, avoided the landmark despite having visited and resided in the area. It was not until a niece showed the family an alternative viewing spot that I felt great moments missed for not having brought a camera.

Today, I redeemed myself. Took a bus to the usual tourist drop-off, then trekked a trail surrounding the bridge entrance. What turned out to be a real point of intrigue was not the bridge itself, but the people it attracts.

This is one of the result.
