In observation of Chinese New Year, more red cosplay. This one featuring Bur Lorie as Madam Red from Black Butler/Kuroshitsuji.

Although I posted this shot before, the photo you see here is tweaked to be slightly more red. I suspect the abundance of red in her outfit must have skewed my color perception, resulting in my previous upload too green in hue.
