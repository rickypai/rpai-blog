I have vivid memories of flying as a child: I remember little Ricky running around with a stack of Post-It notes, and writing down all the aircraft registration numbers while sitting next to the window at the boarding gate. Why little Ricky cared about registration numbers or had a stack of Post-It notes instead of a proper notebook is beyond the comprehension of modern Ricky, but I guess it shows that my love of aviation carries deep roots.

Fast forward a few years, flying becomes a regular commute between home and school of a young international student. Since the flights, routes, airlines, and even flight numbers are pretty much constant, flying felt very much like a mechanical process not worthy of any attention.

It wasn't until a rather unconventional trip many years after that rekindled my love for aviation. I was in a long distance relationship with my then love interest being in Tokyo at the time. While I didn't expect to see her until many months after, my father suddenly suggested one day "Why don't you just fly over?", a proposal my mother obviously rejected.

Either way, the trip happened, and it was special in many ways: it was the first time in my memory that I flew long haul on a non-Taiwanese or American airline, and I was stunned by the service and the quality of the aircraft. It gave me enough miles to start caring about frequent flier programs, as I missed United Premier by just a narrow two or three thousand miles that year. Above all, it gave me the confidence to travel long distance to foreign lands, a trait I've heavily abused since.

Although the relationship with my then love interest has since ended, I found a new love in flying. About to touch down into Taipei, see you in Kaohsiung.
