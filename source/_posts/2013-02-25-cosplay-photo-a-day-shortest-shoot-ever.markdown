This was my shortest shoot ever, with the first to last serious photo spanning only five minutes.

Although this was sort of cheating, as everything was already set up and I had a great photographer to help me with lighting directions. I was supposed to just stop by and say hi, but couldn't help to take a few photos of these gorgeous ladies.

Lucia as Ruiko and DD as Majoko, both from Zone 00.

The longest shoot, in contrast, was 8 full hours, with the previous night a near all-nighter trying to help cosplayers getting their costumes done.
