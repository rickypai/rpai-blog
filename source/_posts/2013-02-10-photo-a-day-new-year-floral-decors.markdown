A floral arrangement enthusiast, my mother bought a bunch of flowers to decorate our living room in celebration of Chinese New Year. You can also see the reflection of legs of me, my mother, and my father, so this is also sort of a family photo~ My sister, Fendi, was in the corner and it was quite a feat to get her to stand still!

Also, my sister and I wishes you all a happy Chinese New Year!!!
